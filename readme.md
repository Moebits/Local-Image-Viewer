# Local Image Viewer

A local image viewer.

Create a folder named "images" in the root directory of the project and add named folders containing images.
You don't have to restart the server in order for image changes to take effect.

To change the folder pass environmental variable FOLDER=foldername.

You can change the color of the site, resize the images, and add some effects (eg. brightness/contrast).

Instructions to start the webserver: \
`npm install` (only run the first time) \
`npm start`
